  "repo_notes": "Splitux is a local co-op split-screen gaming launcher for Linux. It enables multiple players to play games together on a single PC by running isolated game instances with separate controllers, save data, and network identities. Built in Rust with egui for the UI.\n\nCore architecture:\n- Platform abstraction (Steam, GOG, Epic, Manual) - WHERE games come from\n- Backend system (Goldberg, Photon, Facepunch) - HOW multiplayer is enabled\n- Each game instance runs in Gamescope (nested Wayland compositor) + Bubblewrap sandbox\n- Uses fuse-overlayfs for per-player profile isolation\n- Supports Proton/Wine for Windows games via UMU Launcher",
